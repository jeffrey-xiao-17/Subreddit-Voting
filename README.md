 CIS 196 Final Project

 Subreddit Voting is a site where users can vote on their favorite images, gifs, and videos throughout all of Reddit.  Similar to the upvoting system that Reddit provides, Subreddit Voting allows for users to vote across any and all subreddits, creating a more consolidated platform.

 ## Usage
 Usage of the app is relatively simple. Start by creating an account and logging in.  Depending on the mod status of a given user, you may or may not have edit access throughout the site.  Regardless, all users can add new subreddits to the site to load their favorite images, vote on the existing images in place, and see various statistics about votes and top votes visuals.  If you would like, you can also follow other users!
